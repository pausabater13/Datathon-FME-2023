# Barcelona Datathon 2023 - Project Title

## Overview
This repository contains the winning project from the Barcelona Datathon 2023, held at the prestigious Facultat de Matemàtiques i Estadística, University of Barcelona. Our team of data enthusiasts embarked on an exciting journey to tackle a real-world problem using cutting-edge data science techniques.

## Project Description
In this datathon, we were presented with a challenging problem statement that required us to leverage our data analysis and machine learning skills. The project aimed to address a pressing issue by applying data-driven solutions and creating actionable insights.

## Features
- Cutting-edge data analysis
- Innovative machine learning models
- Winning strategies
- Comprehensive data visualization
- Exciting challenges

## Results
Our team's hard work and dedication paid off, and we clinched the first prize at the Barcelona Datathon 2023. Our solution not only addressed the problem but also showcased the power of data science in today's world.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `code/`: Includes all the code and Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and modeling.
- `visualizations/`: This directory contains data visualizations created during the project.
- `results/`: Displays the final results and a summary of our achievements.

## Getting Started
To explore our project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `code/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to review our analysis and models.
3. Check out the `visualizations/` folder for captivating data visualizations.
4. Dive into the `results/` section to see the final outcomes and insights.

## Dependencies
Our project relies on the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
